# CourtListener MCP Server v2.0

A comprehensive Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for accessing the CourtListener API v4 and eCFR, providing powerful legal and regulatory research capabilities optimized for Large Language Model (LLM) interactions.

> **Latest Update (June 2025):** All MCP tools and modules are documented. Pydantic v2 compatibility, type annotations, and import structure are up-to-date. Server passes all lint checks and includes a comprehensive test suite.

## Code Architecture Overview

- **`app/server.py`**: Main FastMCP server, imports all tool modules and sets up logging
- **`app/tools/`**: Contains all MCP tool implementations:
  - `search.py`: Search tools (opinions, dockets, audio, people, RECAP, regulations)
  - `get.py`: Get tools (opinion, docket, audio, court, person, cluster)
  - `citation.py`: Citation lookup, parsing, batch, and enhanced tools
- **`app/models.py`**: Pydantic models for data validation
- **`app/config.py`**: Configuration and environment variable management
- **`app/utils.py``: Utility functions (XML/JSON conversion, etc.)
- **`app/logs/`**: Server logs

## Server Transport

The server is configured to use **streamable-http** transport by default, making it accessible via HTTP at `http://localhost:8000/mcp/`. This allows:

- **HTTP-based access**: Standard HTTP requests for web-based deployments
- **External connections**: Server binds to `0.0.0.0` for network accessibility
- **RESTful interface**: Modern HTTP transport for better integration
- **Production ready**: Suitable for containerized and cloud deployments

To connect to the server programmatically:

```python
from fastmcp import Client

async with Client("http://localhost:8000/mcp/") as client:
    result = await client.call_tool("status")
```

## Modules and Purposes

- **server.py**: FastMCP entrypoint, imports all tool servers
- **tools/search.py**: Implements search tools for opinions, dockets, audio, people, RECAP, regulations
- **tools/get.py**: Implements get tools for detailed entity retrieval (opinion, docket, audio, court, person, cluster)
- **tools/citation.py**: Implements citation lookup, parsing, batch, and enhanced tools
- **models.py**: Pydantic models for API responses and validation
- **config.py**: Loads environment and configures logging
- **utils.py**: XML/JSON conversion, helpers
